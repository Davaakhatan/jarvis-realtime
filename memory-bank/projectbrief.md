## Jarvis Project Brief

### Overview
Jarvis is a cutting-edge real-time voice assistant designed to empower frontline workers with immediate, accurate, and reliable information. Developed by Frontier Audio, it leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline communication and task handling in high-stakes environments where decisions need to be made instantaneously.

**Organization:** Frontier Audio
**Project ID:** VyuiwBOFxfoySBVh4b7D_1762227805787

### Objectives
1. **Zero Latency**: Deliver sub-500 ms end-to-end response time for mission-critical questions.
2. **Complete Accuracy**: Achieve ≥95% accuracy with zero hallucinations - only verifiable responses.
3. **Persistent Context**: Maintain conversation memory and context awareness across sessions.
4. **Safe Integration**: Integrate securely with public GitHub repositories and third-party APIs.

### Scope
- Software stack covering speech capture, streaming transcription, LLM orchestration, knowledge integrations, and response playback.
- Operational tooling for API refresh cycles (every 3 minutes), memory management, and GitHub workflow automations.
- MVP excludes advanced UI work, non-English locales, and new hardware development beyond interfacing with existing devices.

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Accuracy | ≥95% verified information delivery |
| Latency | ≤500 ms end-to-end |
| Clarity | ≥90% user ratings for clear/actionable info |
| Intuitiveness | 80% of users proficient within 30 minutes |

### Target Users
1. **Frontline Workers** - Need immediate access to accurate information for real-time decisions
2. **Team Leaders** - Require tools for efficient cross-team communication and task management
3. **IT Managers** - Concerned with integration reliability and security of new technology solutions

### Core Value Proposition
By ensuring zero latency and complete accuracy, Jarvis enhances operational efficiency and decision-making integrity for organizations reliant on critical real-time data. It bridges the gap where current solutions fail to meet demands for real-time, reliable communication tools.
